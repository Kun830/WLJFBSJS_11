## Homework 11

### P6.
Obviously, r=4.

a. R = 1001

b. R = 1101

c. R = 1111

### P10. 
a. Suppose the bandwidth of the channel is R bps. The effective timeslot for A should satisfy A's transmission and B's not in transmission. So the average throughput of A should be T_a = R * p_a(1-p_b). Similarly, the probability of B's effectiveness should be p_b(1-p_a), so the total effectiveness should be p_a(1-p_b) + p_b(1-p_a). 

b. No. Based on the formula given in section a, the throughput of A and B are influenced by both the value of p_a and p_b. To make p_a(1-p_b) = 2p_b(1-p_a), we have p_a = 2p_b/(1+p_b)

c. The average throughput of A is R * 2p(1-p)^(N-1), and the average throughput of other nodes is R * p(1-2p)^(N-1).

### P13.
It's known that if every node in the network have enough bits to transfer, there will be Q bits transmitted in Q/R+d_poll seconds int each poll cycle. So the maximum throughput will be Q/(Q/R+d_poll) = QR/(Q+R·d_poll).

### P18.
When t=0, the frame is emitted from A, and the frame will be received at t=576. In the worst circumstances, the signal from B will be emitted at t=324, and A will notice the interference at t=649, and the signal transmission from A has finished. So in the worst circumstance, A can finish the transmission. 

### P20.
a. Suppose the number of non-productive timeslots is Y, and the probability of being productive of each empty slot is β.

We have that P(Y=m)=β(1-β)^m. This is a geometric distribution, and then we have the expectation of the distribution x=1/β-1. 

We can see that β=Np(1-p)^(N-1). So the effectiveness should be k/(k+x) = k/(k+(1-Np(1-p)^(N-1))/Np(1-p)^(N-1))

b. To maximize the effectiveness, the value of x should be minimize, and the value of β should be maximize. So we can find that when p=1/N, we can have the maximum effectiveness.

c. When n->∞, k/(k+x) = k/(k+(1-(1-p)^(N-1))/(1-p)^(N-1)) = k/(k+e-1)

d. When the length of the frame grows, which means the value of k grows, we can suppose that the value of k converges to positive infinity, and the effectiveness k/(k+x) will approaches to 1.
