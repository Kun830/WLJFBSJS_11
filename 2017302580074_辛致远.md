# P2.
For example, 

| code| code | code | parity |
|--| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | -- |

If there is a single bit error at row 1 colum 1, then we can locate this error by the parity code. 
| code| code | code | parity |
|--| -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | !0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| !0 | 0 | 1 | -- |

If there is a double bit error at row 1 colum 1, then we only know there is an error at the first row, but we cannot locate it. 
| code| code | code | parity |
|--| -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | !0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | -- |


# P8.
a.  
The derivation is   
$N(1-p)^{N-1}-N(N-1)p(1-p)^{N-2}=(N-N^2p)(1-p)^{n-2}$, 
so $p=\frac{1}{N}$ maximizes this expression. 
b.  
The efficiency is 
$N*\frac{1}{N}(1-\frac{1}{N})^{N-1}=\frac{1}{e}$
# P13.
The total polling delay is $Nd_p$. In the best case, all nodes transmit $Q$ bits. The total time is $N(d_p+Q/R)$ and thus the throughput is $Q/(d_p+Q/R)$

c.
E passes the datagram to its adapter. The adapter make a frame with the MAC address of the router. Then the router make another frame with the MAC address of the other router. At last the other router send the datagram to B.
d.  
Before E making the frame, it broadcasts an ARP request for the MAC address of B. Then the router between subnet 2 and 3 will broadcasts another ARP request. The router between subnet 1 and 2 will reply this request, and then the first router replies E. then E can send the datagram as described in c. 
# P17.
512 bit time is 51.2 microseconds for a 10 Mbps broadcast channel, and 5.12 microseconds for a 100 Mbps broadcast channel. Thus it waits 5120 microseconds fir a 10 Mbps broadcast channel and 512 microseconds for a 100 Mbps broadcast channel.
