### P10

(a) The average throughout of A is$P_A(1-p_B)$, and the total efficiency is $P_A(1-p_B)+P_B(1-p_A)$.

(b) Throughout of  A is $2P_B-2P_B^2$，throughput of B is $P_B-2P_B^2$, so the throughout of A is not twice as large as that of B. And $P_A=2-(P_A/P_B)$ is what we need.

(c) Average throughput of A is $2p(1-p)^{N-1}$,  and any other node has  $p(1-p)^{N-2}(1-2p)$.
