### Question 1

> **P4.** Suppose the information portion of a packet (D in Figure 6.3 ) contains 10 bytes consisting of 
> a. the binary representation of the numbers 1 through 10. 
> b. the ASCII representation of the letters B through K (uppercase). 
> c. the ASCII representation of the letters b through k (lowercase). 
> Compute the Internet checksum for this data.

>> **My Answer:**

>> a. 
>> 0102 + 0304 + 0506 + 0708 + 090A = 191E
>> ~191E = E6E1

>> b. 
>> 4243 + 4445 + 4647 + 4849 + 4A4B = 00015F63
>> 5F63 + 0001 = 5F64
>> ~5F64 = A09B

>> c. 
>> 6263 + 6465 + 6667 + 6869 + 6A6B = 00020003
>> 0003 + 0002 = 0005
>> ~0005 = FFFA

### Question 2

> **P5.** Consider the 5-bit generator, G=10011 , and suppose that D has the value 1010101010.
What is the value of R?

>> **My Answer:**

>> 1010101010 0000 / 10011 = 1011011100 --- 0100 (remainder)
>> R = 0100

### Question 3

> **P6.** Consider the previous problem, but suppose that D has the value
> a. 1001010101. 
> b. 0101101010. 
> c. 1010100000.

>> **My Answer:**

>> a.
>> 1001010101 0000 / 10011 = 1000110000 --- 0000 (remainder)
>> R = 0000

>> b.
>> 0101101010 0000 / 10011 = 101010101 --- 1111 (remainder)
>> R = 1111

>> c.
>> 1010100000 0000 / 10011 = 1011010111 --- 1001 (remainder)
>> R = 1001

### Question 4

> **P8.** In Section 6.3 , we provided an outline of the derivation of the efficiency of slotted ALOHA. In this problem we’ll complete the derivation.
> a. Recall that when there are N active nodes, the efficiency of slotted ALOHA is Np(1−p)<sup>N−1</sup>. Find the value of p that maximizes this expression.
> b. Using the value of p found in (a), find the efficiency of slotted ALOHA by letting N approach infinity. Hint: (1−1/N)<sup>N</sup> approaches 1/e as N approaches infinity.

>> **My Answer:**

>> a.
>> Let F(p) = Np(1−p)<sup>N−1</sup>
>> We get F'(p) = N(1−p)<sup>N−1</sup> - Np(N-1)(1−p)<sup>N−2</sup> = N(1−p)<sup>N−2</sup>(1-p-p(N-1))
>> Let F'(p) = 0
>> We get 1-p-p(N-1) = 0
>> So p = 1 / N

>> b. 
>> F(p = 1/N) = N * (1/N) * (1−1/N)<sup>N−1</sup> = (1−1/N)<sup>N−1</sup> = (1−1/N)<sup>N</sup> / (1−1/N)
>> Since (1−1/N)<sup>N</sup> approaches 1/e and (1−1/N) approaches 1 as N approaches infinity, the efficiency of slotted ALOHA is 1/e

### Question 5

> **P9.** Show that the maximum efficiency of pure ALOHA is 1/(2e). 

>> **My Answer:**
>> Let F(p) = Np(1−p)<sup>2(N−1)</sup>
>> We get F'(p) = N(1−p)<sup>2(N−1)</sup> - Np2(N-1)(1−p)<sup>2(N−1)-1</sup> = N(1−p)<sup>2(N−1)-1</sup>(1-p-p2(N-1))
>> Let F'(p) = 0
>> We get 1-p-p2(N-1) = 0
>> So p = 1 / (2N - 1)
>> So F(p = 1 / (2N - 1)) = N * (1 / (2N - 1)) * (1−(1 / (2N - 1)))<sup>2(N−1)</sup>
>> Since N * (1 / (2N - 1)) approaches 1/2 and (1−(1 / (2N - 1)))<sup>2(N−1)</sup> approaches 1/e as N approaches infinity,  the maximum efficiency of pure ALOHA is 1/2 * 1/e = 1/(2e)
