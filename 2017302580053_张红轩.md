## 1.P1

![P1](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P1.png)

 Due to the minimum-length checksum field we have to use, the bit pattern should be resize to 4\*4:

![P1_bit pattern 1](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P1_a1.png)

And we use the even parity scheme, so the checksum field should be like:

![P1_bit pattern 2 with check sum](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P1_a2.png)

And the checksum field have to use 9 bits.

## 2.P2

![P2](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P2.png)

Now we use the answer we got in P1 to illustrate:

When an error occurs at the bit which the arrow point to:

![P2_bit pattern 1](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P2_a1.png)

We can easily ascertain the two checksum bit which could told us where the error occurs, and correct it with two checksum bit:

![P2_bit pattern 2](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P2_a2.png)

But when the number of errors is two, for example:

 ![P2_bit pattern 3 double bit error](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P2_a3.png)

The checksum bits circled by the red box can told us where the error occurs, but we can't correct it due to the checksum bit which is pointed by the red arrow gives us no information about the two incorrect bit.

And here is another example which is more complicated:

## 3.P10

![P10](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P10.png)

a.  Let A's average throughput be T<sub>A</sub>, B's average throughput be T<sub>B</sub>, 

​	 T<sub>A</sub> = R*P<sub>A</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>) ,  because at any slot the probability of A begins a transmission  but others (B) not  is 

​							P<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>A</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>),  correspondingly,   T<sub>B</sub> = R*P<sub>B</sub>(1-P<sub>A</sub>)

​     	So the total throughput should be T = R\*P<sub>A</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>)  + R\*P<sub>B</sub>(1-P<sub>A</sub>)  = R(P<sub>A</sub>+P<sub>B</sub> - P<sub>A</sub>*P<sub>B</sub>)

b.  If we let P<sub>A</sub>=2P<sub>B</sub> , we have T<sub>A</sub> = R*P<sub>A</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>)  =  2R\*P<sub>B</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>), 

​		and the T<sub>B</sub> = R*P<sub>B</sub>(1-P<sub>A</sub>), 

​		we have T<sub>A</sub>/T<sub>B</sub> = 2\*(1-P<sub>B</sub>)/(1-P<sub>A</sub>)

​		since  (1-P<sub>B</sub>)/(1-P<sub>A</sub>) != 1, so A' average throughput is not twice as large as the B's.



​		But if we want   R*P<sub>A</sub>(1-P<sub>B</sub>) = 2R\*P<sub>B</sub>(1-P<sub>A</sub>) , simply it we can get that:

​     	P<sub>A</sub> = 2\*P<sub>B</sub>/(1+P<sub>B</sub>)

c. 

 T<sub>A</sub> = R*2P(1-P)<sup>N-1</sup>

Let other nodes' average throughput be T<sub>o</sub>

T<sub>o</sub> = R*P(1-2P)<sup>N-1</sup>

## 4.P12

The graph of efficiency of slotted ALOHA is:

![slot](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/slot.jpg)

The graph of efficiency of pure ALOHA is:

![pure](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/pure.jpg)

The code is shown below:

```matlab
%% slotted ALOHA
p = 0:0.001:1;
for N = [15,25,35]
    P_slot = N.*p.*(1-p).^(N-1);
    f = plot(p,P_slot);
    hold on;
end
legend('N=15','N=25','N=35')



%% pure ALOHA
p = 0:0.001:1;
for N = [15,25,35]
    P_slot = N.*p.*(1-p).^(2*(N-1));
    f = plot(p,P_slot);
    hold on;
end
legend('N=15','N=25','N=35')
 
```

## 5.P13

![P13](https://github.com/HongxuanZhang/Network_Pictures/blob/master/homework11/P13.png)

The time needed to complete a whole poll is 

t = N(d<sub>poll</sub> + Q/R)

The number of bits transfer in the time t is:

N<sub>bit</sub> = N\* Q

The throughput is  N<sub>bit</sub>/t = R/(1+d<sub>poll</sub>\*R/Q)

So the maximum throughput of broadcast channel is  R/(1+d<sub>poll</sub>\*R/Q)
