If we divide 10011 into 1010101010  0000, we get 1011011100, with a remainder of R=0100.  Note that, G=10011 is CRC-4-ITU standard.**P6**a) we get 1000110000, with a remainder of R=0000. b) we get 0101010101, with a remainder of R=1111. c) we get 1011010111, with a remainder of R=1001.**P10**a) A’s average throughput is given by pA(1-pB).  Total efficiency is pA(1-pB) + pB(1-pA).  b) A’s throughput is pA(1-pB)=2pB(1-pB)= 2pB- 2(pB)2. B’s throughput is pB(1-pA)=pB(1-2pB)= pB- 2(pB)2. Clearly, A’s throughput is not twice as large as B’s. In order to make pA(1-pB)= 2 pB(1-pA), we need that pA= 2 – (pA / pB).  c) A’s throughput is 2p(1-p)N-1, and any other node has throughput p(1-p)N-2(1-2p). **P18**At t=0 A transmits. At t=567 , A would finish transmitting. In the worst case, B begins transmitting at time t=324, which is the time right before the first bit of A’s frame arrives at B. At time t=324+325=649 B 's first bit arrives at A . Because 649> 576, A finishes transmitting before it detects that B has transmitted. So A incorrectly thinks that its frame was successfully transmitted without a collision. **P22**i) from A to switch: Source MAC address: 00-00-00-00-00-00            Destination MAC address: 55-55-55-55-55-55            Source IP: 111.111.111.001            Destination IP: 133.333.333.003 ii) from switch to right router: Source MAC address: 00-00-00-00-00-00               Destination MAC address: 55-55-55-55-55-55      Source IP: 111.111.111.001      Destination IP: 133.333.333.003  iii) from right router to F: Source MAC address: 88-88-88-88-88-88          Destination MAC address: 99-99-99-99-99-99          Source IP: 111.111.111.001          Destination IP: 133.333.333.003 i) from A to switch: Source MAC address: 00-00-00-00-00-00            Destination MAC address: 55-55-55-55-55-55            Source IP: 111.111.111.001            Destination IP: 133.333.333.003 ii) from switch to right router: Source MAC address: 00-00-00-00-00-00               Destination MAC address: 55-55-55-55-55-55      Source IP: 111.111.111.001      Destination IP: 133.333.333.003  iii) from right router to F: Source MAC address: 88-88-88-88-88-88          Destination MAC address: 99-99-99-99-99-99          Source IP: 111.111.111.001          Destination IP: 133.333.333.003
