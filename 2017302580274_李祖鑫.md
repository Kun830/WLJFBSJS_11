# Homework 11


## P1

The two-dimensional parity scheme is given by

1 1 1 0 | 1

0 1 1 0 | 0

1 0 0 1 | 0

1 1 0 1 | 1

_

1 1 0 0

## P2

We use the example given by P1.If the bits on row 1, column 1 is altered, such that

0 1 1 0 | 1 x

0 1 1 0 | 0

1 0 0 1 | 0

1 1 0 1 | 1

_

1 1 0 0

x

Then there is an error detected on row 1, as well as on column 1, then we can locate the position of the error, and alter it back to the correct one.


0 1 1 0 | 1 x

1 1 1 0 | 0 x

1 0 0 1 | 0

1 1 0 1 | 1

_

1 1 0 0

Here suppose row 1 and row 2 on column 1 has error. We can detect them, but there is no way to locate the error bit, so we cannot correct them.


## P5

The value R is given by

```
R = (D* 2^5) %G = 

10101010100000 % 10011 = 0100
```

## P6

Applying the same calculation on P5, we have

### a

```

1001010101 * 10000 % 10011 = 0000

```

### b

```

0101101010 * 10000 % 10011 = 1111

```

### c

```

1010100000 * 10000 % 10011 = 1001

```

## P7

### a

We have `(D*2^r + R) /G = 0(mod2) => (D*2^r+ R+ 2^i) /G = 1 (mod2)`

When any single bit i error, there has a remainder on right hand side, thus it can detect any single bit error.

### b

Since odd number of bits will not keeps the remainder equation`(D*2^r + R) /G = 0(mod2)` holds, so odd number errors will be able to be detected.
