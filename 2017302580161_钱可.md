Homework 11

P 1:

1 1 1 0  1

0 1 1 0	 0

1 0 0 1	 0

1 1 0 1	 1

1 1 0 0	 0


P 3:

The 16-bit sum of "Networking" is:

   01001100 01101001

+ 01101110 01101011

+ 00100000 01001100

+ 01100001 01111001

+ 01100101 01110010

——————————————————

= 10100010 00001100

So the internet checksum is 01011101 11110011


P 5:

R = remainder(D*2^r/G)

r = 4

So R = remainder(1010101010 * 2^4 / 10011) = remainder(10101010100000 / 10011) = 0100


P 6:

a.  R = remainder(10010101010000 / 10011) = 0000

b.  R = remainder(01011010100000 / 10011) = 1111

c.  R = remainder(10101000000000 / 10011) = 1001


P 11:

a. In each slot, the probability of A succeeds is p(1-p)^3

A failed in slot 1~4 and succeeds in slot 5

So  P = (1-p(1-p)^3)^4 * p(1-p)^3

b. P = 4p(1-p)^3

c. In one slot, the probability of no node succeeds is  1 - 4 p(1-p)^3

so the probability of that first node success is in slot 3 is:

P = (1-4p(1-p)^3)^2*4p(1-p)^3

d. efficiency = P(some node succeeds in one slot) = 4p(1-p)^3
