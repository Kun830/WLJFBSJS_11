According to the rules of ascii, we can calculate the internet checksum using the following method:

   01001110 01100101

\+ 01101110 01101011

= 10111010 11010100 

\+ 00100000 01001100

= 11011011 00100000 

\+ 01100001 01111001

= 00111100 10011010

\+ 01100101 01110010 

= 10100010 00001100

Thus, the internet checksum is 01011101 11110011.

$$
R=remainder\frac{D*2^r}{G}=remainder \frac{10101010100000}{10011}=0100
$$
Thus, the value of R is 0100.

a.

First, we can take the derivative of this function:
$$
f(p)=Np(1-p)^{N-1}
$$

$$
f'(p)=N(1-p)^{N-1}-(N-1)*N*p(1-p)^{N-2}
$$



As we know N and (1-p) will not be 0:  (p is a probability)
$$
(1-p) = (N-1)*p
$$
So when Np = 1, that is, p = 1/N, the expression(efficiency) will reach its maximum value.



b.

when p =1/N:
$$
Np(1-p)^{N-1} = {(1-\frac{1}{N})^{N}}{(\frac{N}{N-1})}
$$
when N is infinite, the value is 1/e. 



**P10**

a: The average throughput is pa(1-pb). And the total efficiency is pA(1-pB) + pB(1-pA).

b: when pa = 2pb, the average throughput of a is not twice the throughput of b because:

​	2pb(1-pb) is not equal to 2pb(1-2pb)

​	And this might happen when pa(1-pb) = 2pb(1-pa), pa*pb = 2pb - pa.

​	That is, when pa = 2 - (pa/pb)

c: The average throughput of a is 
$$
2p(1-p)^{N-1}
$$
​	And the other nodes' is 
$$
p(1-2p)(1-p)^{N-2}
$$
