### Problems in the sixth chapter

#### Problem 3

 Suppose the information portion of a packet (*D* in **Figure 6.3** ) contains 10 bytes consisting of the 8-bit unsigned binary ASCII representation of string “Networking.” Compute the Internet checksum for this data.

***Answer:*** The Internet checksum of this data is:

0100 1100 0110 1001 + 0110 1110 0110 1011 + 0010 0000 0100 1100               + 0110 0101 0111 0010 = 1010 0010 0000 1100

So the Internet checksum of this data is: 0101 1101 1111 0011.



#### Problem 5

Consider the 5-bit generator, G=10011, and suppose that D has the value 1010101010. What is the value of R?

***Answer:*** R=remainder((D*(2^4))/G)=remainder(10101010100000/10011)=0100



#### Problem 6

Consider the previous problem, but suppose that *D* has the value

> a. 1001010101.

***Answer:*** R=remainder((D*(2^4))/G)=remainder(10010101010000/10011)=0000

> b. 0101101010.

***Answer:*** R=remainder((D*(2^4))/G)=remainder(01011010100000/10011)=1111

> c. 1010100000.

***Answer:*** R=remainder((D*(2<sup>4</sup>))/G)=remainder(10101000000000/10011)=1001



#### Problem 11

Suppose four active nodes—nodes A, B, C and D—are competing for access to a channel using slotted ALOHA. Assume each node has an infinite number of packets to send. Each node attempts to transmit in each slot with probability *p*. The first slot is numbered slot 1, the second slot is numbered slot 2, and so on.

> a. What is the probability that node A succeeds for the first time in slot 5?

***Answer:*** P=(1-p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>4</sup> * 4p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>

> b. What is the probability that some node (either A, B, C or D) succeeds in slot 4?

***Answer:*** P=4p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>

> c. What is the probability that the first success occurs in slot 3?

***Answer:*** P=(1-4p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> * 4p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>

> d. What is the efficiency of this four-node system?

***Answer:*** P=4p(1-p)<sup>3</sup>



#### Problem 13

Consider a broadcast channel with *N* nodes and a transmission rate of *R* bps. Suppose the broadcast channel uses polling (with an additional polling node) for multiple access. Suppose theamount of time from when a node completes transmission until the subsequent node is permitted to transmit (that is, the polling delay) is *d*poll. Suppose that within a polling round, a given node is allowed to transmit at most *Q* bits. What is the maximum throughput of the broadcast channel?

***Answer:*** 

The length of a whole poll: N(*d*poll+Q/R).

The number of bits transferred in a poll: NQ.

So the maximum throughput of the broadcast channel: 

NQ/N(*d*poll+Q/R) = Q/(*d*poll+Q/R).
