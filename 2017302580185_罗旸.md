a. For D is 1001010101, G is 10011 and r is 4:
$$
R=remainder(\frac{D*2^r}{G})=0000
$$
b. For D is 0101101010, G is 10011 and r is 4:
$$
R=remainder(\frac{D*2^r}{G})=1111
$$
c. For D is 1010100000, G is 10011 and r is 4:
$$
R=remainder(\frac{D*2^r}{G})=1001
$$

**P10**

a. The average throughput of A is $p_A(1-p_B)$. The total efficiency is $p_A(1-p_B)+p_B(1-p_A)$.

b. No. When $p_A=2p_B$, The average throughput of A is $2p_B(1-p_B)=2p_B-2p_B^2$, and the average throughput of B is $p_B(1-2p_B)=p_B-2p_B^2$. Clearly, $2p_B-2p_B^2\neq2*(p_B-2p_B^2)$.

To make the average throughput of A is twice as large as the average throughput of B: $p_A(1-p_B)=2*(p_B(1-p_A))$, $p_A=\frac{2p_B}{1+p_B}$.

c. The average throughput of A is $2p(1-p)^{N-1}$, and the average throughput of any other node is $p(1-p)^{N-2}(1-2p)$.

**P11**

a. The probability that A can succeed in a slot is $p(1-p)^3$. The probability of A failing in the first four slots is  $(1-p(1-p)^3)^4$. Thus, the probability of A succeeding first in slot 5 is $(1-p(1-p)^3)^4p(1-p)^3$

b. p(either A or B or C or D succeeds in slot 4) =$ 4 p(1-p)^3$.

c. p(first success occurs in slot 3)=$ (1-4 p(1-p)^3)^2* 4 p(1-p)^3$.

d. efficiency = p(success in a slot) =$4 p(1-p)^3$.

**P18**

At *t* = 0 *A* transmits. 

At *t* = 576 , *A* would finish transmitting. In the worst case, *B* begins transmitting at time t=324, which is the time right before the first bit of Aâ€™s frame arrives at B. 

At time t=324+325=649 *B* 's first bit arrives at *A* . Because 649> 576, *A* finishes transmitting before it detects that B has transmitted. 

So A incorrectly thinks that its frame was successfully transmitted without a collision.
