## Assignment 11
### p7
a. We assume that ith bit has become wrong where 0<=i<d+r and the least sginificant bit is 0th bit. So the received bit should be D*2^rXOR R, we set the accurate one is I, then the wrong one will be I+2i, if we divide with G then the remainder is not 0, we can know that there should be an error in the received data.

b. Yes, we know 1001 can be divided by 11. and every sequence which has odd-number 1s can't be divided by 11. So not to mention be divided by 1001, which is just G. As a result, it can detect odd-number of 1s error.

### p8
a. We can define a function of p:
f(p)=Np(1-p)^(N-1). The we get its derivation: f'(p)=N(1-p)^(N-1)-Np(N-1)(1-p)^(N-2). We make f'(p)=0, then p=1/N.

b. We put 1/N in the expression. We get lim f(1/N)=1/e.

### p10 
a. A's average throughouput should be pA(1-pB). The overall efficiency should be pA(1-pB)+pB(1-pA).

b. When pA=2pB, we can't get A's throughoutput is twice as large as B's. In order to make pA(1-pB)=2pB(1-pA), we simplify this equation and get pA=2-（pA/pB）.

c. [2p(1-p)^(N-1)+(N-1)p((1-p)^(N-2))(1-2p)]/N

### p17
When K=100, you should wait for 51200 bit times, for 10Mbps, you have to wait 51200/10^7=5.12ms.

For 100Mbps, the wait is 512us.
